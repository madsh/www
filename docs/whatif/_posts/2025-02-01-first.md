**What if I could get in the habit of writing a blog post every other week?**

For decades I have been scribbling in a various notebooks, resulting in nothing more than a comfy feeling of stashing ideas for future use. Few have been consistent or comprehensible enough to be shared. 

Now would be a good time to align phases and hope for constructive interference.

Publishing can be done in many ways and with many purposes. I choose to stay clear of likes, logs and laundering commentary.  

Setting a reminder for Wednesdays in even weeks.
