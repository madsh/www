This is the personal homepage of <span class="p-name fn n"><span class="given-name">Mads</span> <span class="additional-name">Lindegård</span> <span class="family-name">Hjorth</span></span>. I spend most days in <span class="p-locality">Copenhagen</span> where I live with my family and make a living designing government it-solutions.

The primary function of this page is to provide a stable online presence and serve as a point of contact. The email I read most often is <span class="u-email">madsh@me.com</span>.

Maybe one day here will be a blog. Possibly called ‘What If...?’ and chronic ideas of things in public digitization that could be, and the reasons why they aren’t.

## Currently
