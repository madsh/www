This is my personal homepage. I spend most days in <span class="adr"><span class="p-locality locality">Copenhagen</span></span><span class="postal-code" style="display: none;">1620</span><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Denmark</span> where I live with my family and make a living designing government it-solutions.

The primary function of this page is to provide a stable online presence and serve as a point of contact. The email I read most often is <span class="u-email">madsh@me.com</span>.

Maybe one day here will be a blog. Possibly called ‘What If...?’ and chronic ideas of things in public digitization that could be, and the reasons why they aren’t.
