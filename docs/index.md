This is my personal homepage. I spend most days in <span class="adr"><span class="p-locality locality">Copenhagen</span></span><span class="postal-code" style="display: none;">1620</span><span class="country-name" style="display: none;">Denmark</span> with my family and make a living designing government it-solutions.

This page is a stable online presence and a point of contact. The email I read most often is <span class="u-email">madsh@me.com</span>.

Maybe one day, here will be a blog. Possibly called ‘What If...?’ and chronic ideas of things in public digitisation that could be, and the reasons why they aren't.

### Services
I do short term consultations outside of my everyday work. You can hire me for a few hours of either meeting, teaching or producing pages that print well. Contact me at <a href="mailto:madsh+work@me.com?subject=Request%20for%20service">madsh+work@me.com</a> for availability, possible conflict of interests and hourly rates.
